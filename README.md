## Web Developer

The objective of this take home is to demonstrate your skills as a web
developer, with a focus on code quality, maintainability, and attention to
detail.

### Task

Implement a complete landing page (HTML, Javascript, CSS) based on this [Dribble design](https://dribbble.com/shots/2905982-Marketing-Page-Exercise). We've included a folder of assets that you can use in your project.

The content of the footer should be rendered by making an API call. The endpoint is `http://interview.plaid.com/data/footer.json`.


*Note: For simplicity, feel free to leave off the HIRING tag on the Jobs link in the footer.*

### Criteria
- **Completeness**: is your implementation complete to the specifications and
  mockups?
- **Correctness**: does it use HTML5, JS and CSS3 best practices? is it written
  in a clean, maintainable way?
- **Aesthetically pleasing**: does it closely follow the design mockups?

### Not required

- We know there is limited time and that browser compatibility and responsive design are a
  time-consuming task. Focus on a single platform and environment ONLY
  (such as Chrome on OS X)
- Don’t use frameworks like React or Angular. The focus of this assignment is
  to take a design mockup to a production ready static web page without too
  much additional Javascript logic

### Timeline

We're expecting this to take between 5 to 6 hours to complete. You'll be given
48 hours to submit the task after receiving this prompt.

### Future improvements

See the **Future improvements** section in the `TEMPLATE_README.md` file for
details regarding suggested improvements.

### Submission

Complete the `TEMPLATE_README.md` document with the required information.
You can then compress your project into a `.zip` file and send via email to
your recruiting coordinator, or send a link to a private Bitbucket or GitHub
repository – your recruiting coordinator will let you know which
Bitbucket/GitHub users will need to be provided access to the repository.
